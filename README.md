# Temperature-Forecasting-using-Arima-Sarima-Facebook-and-LSTM-
Temperature Forecasting using Arima, Sarima, Facebook, and LSTM and dumping the best model using pickle for later use (web page creating an application etc..)
In this repository you'll find a jupiter notebook that i have created to train Arima, Sarima, FaceBook Prophet and RNN (LSTM) to forecast temperature world widly and i studied a special case (my original country Tunisia)
For my case (studying Tunisia) Facebook prophet was better than all other models, so at the end of the jupiter NoteBook youll find how to dumb and load the facebook prohpet model into Python IDE (tem_pred.py )and use it to make a simple web site to predict temperature inserting a starting date and an ending date using Streamlit library.
